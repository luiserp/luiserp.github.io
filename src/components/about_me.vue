                    <p class="mt-2 text-base sm:text-lg text-justify">I'm Luis Enrique Reyes PÃ©rez, a Computer Sciences Enginier graduated at The University of Informatics Sciences in Havana Cuba (Honour Student). I'm always looking something new to learn and the perfect situations for apliying it. I like to see how a project grow organically, according with the needs and requirements. I have used a lot of technologies and tools in my conding adventures and I realized that Artificial Intelligence and Web development are my favorite fields of computer science so I focused on them.

                    <p class="mt-2 text-base sm:text-lg text-justify">The web is the most used platform today, it puts millions of people and companies in contact. Every year new technologies and frameworks emerge that facilitate development and add new features that improve the user experience. As a web developer I have developed applications for the institutions I have worked for using different programming languages and frameworks. I have experience with frameworks such as Angular and Vue on the frontend and Django (Python), Flask (Python), Express (NodeJs) and Slim (PHP) on the backend.

                    <p class="mt-2 text-base sm:text-lg text-justify">I love mathematics and probability and as a computer engineer I decided that artificial intelligence would be one of the branches of computer science in which to specialize. The availability of data and the various options of tools to process them have made this field develop exponentially. Using tools like sklearn, tensorflow and keras I have developed models to solve various problems, from image classification with transfer of learning to natural language processing and computer vision. I still have a lot to learn but everything I lack I make up for with great curiosity.
