The app has a CLI that can be used to start the servers, add new documentations, list and delete existing ones. Even though it's a simple app, it was extremely helpful in letting me read the tech documentation anywhere and without an internet connection. By developing it I was able to put into practice concepts such as multithreading, development of command line interfaces and a basic understanding of an http server.",

The application is a SPA that can list the products by category, show details (images, description and prices) and add them to the cart. Also, the app has user authentication, cart status manager and payment simulation. It was developed by splitting the app into frontend and backend, doing the backend with Django and Django Rest Framework and the frontend with Vue was a really good hands-on exercise to test my new skills.",
